= Complete Roguelike Tutorial, using Rust + tcod
ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

This is a port of the (in)famous Python+libtcod tutorial:

http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod


The code is all implemented but we plan to clean it up in a few places before
splitting it into parts and writing the tutorial text.

The text is in the `doc` directory, you can look at the rendered tutorial at:

== Running the tutorial code

If you want to try running a part of the tutorial using the reference code here,
all you have to do is run this cargo command:

`cargo run --bin name-of-part`

For example, if you would like to run the reference code that is at the end of Part 1
then you run this command:

`cargo run --bin part-1b-movement`
